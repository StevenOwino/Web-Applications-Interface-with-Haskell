-- PRINCPLE OF THE RECIPROCAL(An Essay by Steven Owino)

-- To understand the problem of SELF-ADJOINTNESS for the Momentum operator(P), there is an extra term that does not
-- satisfy the required rules of relation in Cartesian coordinates i.e, Its not Square-Integrable.
-- We thus need the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE to solve,
-- or implement a Complex Valued Function on the total Associated Space of the Principal Bundle,
-- and not in Euclidean space(R^d),
-- by eliminitating the extra term by, choosing an Omega(a unit operator) appropriately.
--
-- A Covariant Derivative acting on the vector field solves the problem of the extra term contrary to a function,
-- to achieve self-adjointntness (A tensor bundle in the manifold)
-- The DETERMINANT of the Bilinear form is NOT scalar, for it picks an INVERSE factor which is an inner-product,
-- also called an OPERATOR, inserted in the VECTOR FIELD[In the case of a one-form base space in the Yang-Mills Field]
-- for any choice of Coordinates in a Manifold.
-- Now, for any LOCAL manifold, 
-- we can now realize the COMMUTATOR RELATION and SELF-ADJOINTNESS on a curved space, since P is WELL-DEFINED.
-- Here we have 2 REAL Omegas on the GRADIENT FIELD.
-- 
-- UTILITY : 
--
-- (I)The push-forward of the vector field only EXISTS, if the map is an ISOMORPHISM 
-- i.e, the TRANSFORMATION does NOT change the MATRICES(witchcraft) 

-- (II) Conserved Quantities: The POTENTIAL on a Rotating Vector Field on a chosen axis does NOT change
-- It is an INVARAINT or also termed as a QUADRATURE UNIT OF ROTATION) 

-- (III) Theorems: Every Left-Invariant vector field on a LIE GROUP is complete 
-- i.e, the DERIVATIVE of the IDENTITY is the TANGENT VECTOR/BUNDLE, and as such, SATISFIES the Commutator Relation.

-- (IV) Differential Topology, where a FUNCTION is a homotopy EQUIVALANCE with respect to the IDENTITY MAP.

-- (V) FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 
-- If a PREDICATE/AXIOMS of a SYSTEM of a left-hand operator is TRUE, 
-- then the right hand operator cannot affect the result of the LOGICAL-OR operator, and is thus NOT evaluated. 
-- This causes us to evaluate the "Then" branch.
-- In a PURE TYPE SYSTEM (Programming Languages) like System F, Coq, Haskell, RUST,..
-- an ENUMERATION e.g, Graham's Scan Algorithm, is implemented by writing a Function as Series of Equations, 
-- to get an ordered SET of BOUNDARY points. 
-- Thus, knowing the signature of the function alone LIMITS the possible valid behaviors it could have and 
-- makes the JOB of understanding CODE easier.
-- Whence we know which part of the code has side effects, and then be appropriately on GUARD.
--
-- CONCLUSION: 
-- Technically, it is necesary for CONSTRUCTIVE LOGIC to reason about proofs and formulas.
-- In the case above, for the DERIVATIVE of an IDENTITY, there is a need to PRESERVE the condition of an INVERSE, or
-- a CONJUGATE EQUIVALANCE RELATION, and that this condition is trivial in a CARTESIAN COORDINATE/PRODUCT.
-- Here the LINEAR BASIS is recovered as the KERNEL of an Omega SUBSPACE i.e, DIFFERENTIATED.
-- H_p(P) = Ker(Omega_p) is defined as 
-- X being an Element of T_p(P) sent to Omega_p(X_p) = 0 ; The IDENTITY BASIS
--
-- The entire STRUCTURE of MATHEMATICS is based on the WELL-DEFINED notion that:
-- There is ALWAYS a NEGATIVE SIGN in the COMPOSITION of an IDENTITY. i.e, a negative EXPONENT yields a FRACTION,
-- which is an INVERSE operation, and IMPLIES no further extension to the SYSTEM. 
--
-- Clearly, from the Master of us all, Euler gives the DEFINITION of a  LOGARITHM, as the EXPONENT of an INVOLUTION.
--
-- AND....
--
-- Henri Lebesgue gives the required DEFINITION of an INTEGRAL:
-- as a FUNCTION with an ABSOLUTE VALUE greater than Epsilon.
--
-- The objective of this short essay is to clearly address the need for Functional Programmers to understand 
-- the PRINCIPLE OF THE RECIPROCAL, the non-commutative relation condition emerging in a Cartesian Coordinate 
-- for a given Complex-Dimensional Manifold, and the COMPLETE FORMULATION of a TANGENT SPACE.
