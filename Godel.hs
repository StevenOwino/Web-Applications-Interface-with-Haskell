-- file: Determine the Godel Number of a term of a context-free language by enumeration ordering (Sequence of objects in a formal system)
-- Greatly tightened Analysis, and commentary of a weak formal system 
-- Proof is an Equality
-- Imports/extensions, a data type representing the grammar, and a pretty-printer
-- APPROACH: Implementing c = 2 Aleph ^ Null (COUNTABLE SETS) : Cardinality of the REALS 
-- Function defined machine-theoretically, to a low-level formal system
-- Code a formula as a list of Natural Numbers, then
-- Code that list using Cantors' pairing function to index into infinite list of inhabitants (Countable sets)

-- let's define the enumeration order. We'll use two basic combinators:
-- +++ for interleaving two lists (mnemonic: the middle character is a sum,
-- so we're taking elements from either the first argument or the second) and
-- +*+ for the diagonalization (mnemonic: the middle character is a product, so we're taking elements
-- from both the first and second arguments)
-- One invariant we'll maintain is that our lists 
-- with the exception of digits -- are always infinite(Countable Set). This will be important later.

-- Lets see a few terms: In GHCI , 
-- *Main> mapM_ (putStrLn . pp) (take 15 ss)                -- projects the associated function
-- Let's assume we have two infinite lists a and b.
-- First, in a +++ b, all the even indices come from a, and all the odd indices come from b.
-- So we can look at the last bit of an index to see which list to look in,
-- and the remaining bits to pick an index in that list.
-- Second, in a +*+ b, we can use the standard bijection(integer multiplication) between pairs of numbers and 
-- single numbers to translate between indices in the big list and pairs of indices in the a and b lists
-- We'll define a class for Godel-able things that can be translated back and forth between numbers
-- indices into the infinite list of inhabitants.
-- Later we'll check that this translation matches the enumeration we defined above.

-- For the remaining three types, we will, as suggested above, 
-- check the tag bit to decide which constructor to emit,

-- And that's it!
-- We can now "efficiently" translate back and forth between parse trees(Distribute every set S as a member of the the Natural Numbers)
-- and their Godel numbering for this grammar. 
-- Moreover, this translation matches the above enumeration, as you can verify:
-- *Main> map from [0..29] == take 30 ss ; PROOF THAT THE FUNCTION WORKS 
-- There is no proof of the Continuum Hypothesis: It cannot be disproved or proved using the Standard Axioms of Set Theory

-- PROPERTIES of this particular grammar: INVERSE standard of the ordering bits 
-- nonterminals had infinitely many derivations
-- except for the instance for (Nat, Nat), 
-- these Godel numberings look at/produce one bit (or trit) at a time. 
-- So you could imagine doing some streaming.
-- But the (Nat, Nat) one is pretty nasty:
-- You have to know the whole number ahead of time to compute the sqrt.
-- You actually can turn this into a streaming, too, without losing the property of being dense 
-- (every Nat being associated with a unique (Nat, Nat)
